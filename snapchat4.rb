#The Beaties:
		#Great set status & flash methods, perfect use of booleans
		#Nice reader methods
		#Overall, great ways to get started thinking about the different classes functionalities and how they interact with each other!

#The Beasts: 
		#Would a story belong to a single snap, or to a single user?
		#Would adding a snap id be more concerned with an id or a snap?
		#Next Step: Switch some of the functionality to match with it's concerning classes
